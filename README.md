AI Agent skills for [JustLend DAO](https://justlend.org) on the TRON network. Provides structured instructions and an MCP server that enables AI agents (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor, Codex, etc.) to query market data, check account positions, and analyze DeFi lending data.

> **Distribution:** install this project from [GitHub](https://github.com/justlend/justlend-skills); it is not published to the npm registry. The scoped name in `package.json` identifies the project for local tooling only. Do not run `npm install @justlend/justlend-skills`—clone the repository and run `bash install.sh` as described below. The `npm install` command used inside the clone installs this project's dependencies.

## Features

- **Market Data**: Real-time APY (including mining rewards), TVL, and utilization for all JustLend markets
- **Protocol Dashboard**: Total supply, borrow, TVL, user count across the protocol
- **Account Analysis**: Health factor monitoring, liquidation risk assessment, balance queries
- **Token Allowances**: Check TRC20 approval status for JustLend contracts
- **Energy Direct Purchase Workflow**: Quote, explicitly confirm, submit, track, and recover backend-broadcast energy payments through the full MCP server

- **JustLend V2**: Isolated-market lending — curated ERC4626 supply vaults + permissionless `(collateral, loan)` borrow markets, with per-market `risk`/`lltv`, liquidation, and history (see the [V2 skill](skills/justlend-lending-v2/SKILL.md))

> For advanced features (V2 lending, sTRX staking, energy rental/direct purchase, governance voting, mining rewards), use the full MCP server: [@justlend/mcp-server-justlend](https://github.com/justlend/mcp-server-justlend) (adds the V2 tools, WTRX wrap/unwrap, and AI prompts).

**When to use this project:** an agent needs to *read* JustLend — market rates, a wallet's position and health, balances, or allowances — with only a TronGrid key and **no signing wallet**.

**When *not* to use it:**
- You need to **move funds** — supply/borrow/repay/withdraw, stake, vote, rent/buy energy, wrap/unwrap. That is the [full MCP server](https://github.com/justlend/mcp-server-justlend) plus a signing wallet, not this project's bundled read server.
- You're on a **non-TRON chain** or a **different protocol** — these skills are JustLend/TRON-only and will not route.
- You want raw node access with **no JustLend context** — call TronGrid directly instead.

## Which Mode to Use

| Mode | What it is | Use when | Writes? |
|------|-----------|----------|:------:|
| **Skills (this repository)** | Agent instruction files (`SKILL.md`) + a bundled read-only MCP server (9 tools) | An agent needs to *query* JustLend — markets, your position/health, balances, allowances | No |
| **Bundled MCP server** (`npm start`) | The 9-tool read-only stdio server shipped here | Same, wired into a client (Claude / Cursor / Codex / OpenCode) | No |
| **CLI** (`node scripts/justlend_api.mjs`) | One-shot terminal queries | Quick manual checks / scripting reads | No |
| **Full MCP server** ([@justlend/mcp-server-justlend](https://github.com/justlend/mcp-server-justlend)) | 98-tool read + **write** server | You need to *act*: supply/borrow/repay/withdraw, stake, rent energy, vote, liquidate | **Yes** (signing wallet required) |

### Skill → dependency matrix

| Skill | Bundled read MCP | Full MCP server | TronGrid key | Signing wallet | Writes? |
|-------|:---------------:|:---------------:|:-----------:|:-------------:|:------:|
| `justlend-dao` (base query) | ✅ | — | ✅ | — | No |
| `justlend-lending-v1` | — | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Yes |
| `justlend-lending-v2` | — | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Yes |
| `justlend-trx-staking` | — | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Yes |
| `justlend-energy-rental` | — | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Yes |
| `justlend-energy-purchase` | — | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Yes |
| `justlend-governance-v1` | — | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Yes |

Read-only skills work with just this repository + a TronGrid key. Every write skill routes through the full server and needs a **signing wallet** (agent-wallet or a browser wallet); the bundled server has no signing capability.

**Graceful degradation.** If the full MCP server or a signing wallet is absent, the read-only skills still work unchanged — the agent can quote rates, read a position, and check allowances, then tell the user exactly what to install (the full server) and connect (a wallet) to act. A write skill invoked without the full server should **stop and report the missing dependency**, never silently no-op or fake a result.

## Supported Markets

| jToken | Underlying | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| jTRX   | TRX       | Native TRON token |

```

## Quick Start

### 1. Install from GitHub

```bash
git clone https://github.com/justlend/justlend-skills.git
cd justlend-skills
bash install.sh
```

Or, after cloning the repository, install its dependencies manually:

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env   # Then edit .env with your keys
```

### 2. Configure

Edit `.env`:

```env
# Required — get from https://www.trongrid.io/
TRONGRID_API_KEY=your_trongrid_api_key

# Network: mainnet (default) or nile (testnet)
NETWORK=mainnet
```

### 3. Run

**As MCP Server** (for AI agents):

```bash
npm start
```

**As CLI Tool** (for quick checks):

```bash
node scripts/justlend_api.mjs markets              # List all markets with APY
node scripts/justlend_api.mjs dashboard            # Protocol dashboard (TVL, users)
node scripts/justlend_api.mjs supported-markets    # List supported markets & addresses
node scripts/justlend_api.mjs balance <addr>       # Check TRX balance
node scripts/justlend_api.mjs balance <addr> USDT  # Check token balance
node scripts/justlend_api.mjs account <addr>       # Account health status
node scripts/justlend_api.mjs account-api <addr>   # Full account data from API
node scripts/justlend_api.mjs jtoken-details <jtoken>  # Detailed jToken info
node scripts/justlend_api.mjs allowance <addr> USDT    # Check TRC20 approval
```

### 4. Verify

```bash
node scripts/justlend_api.mjs markets    # should print a table of markets + APY
npm test                                 # bundled server self-check (if dev deps installed)
```

If `markets` prints rows, the TronGrid key and read path work. An empty result or `401`/`403` means the key is missing or invalid (see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)).

### 5. Upgrade

```bash
cd justlend-skills && git pull && npm install
```

Then restart your agent/client so it re-reads the skill manifests. Breaking changes and migration notes live in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md).

### 6. Uninstall

```bash
bash uninstall.sh    # removes the symlinks install.sh created
```

If you installed under a client directory, also remove that directory and the `skills/` symlink pointing at it.

## Client Configuration

### Claude Desktop

Edit `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "justlend": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO/justlend-skills/scripts/mcp_server.mjs"],
      "env": {
        "TRONGRID_API_KEY": "your_key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Cursor

Add to `.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "justlend": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO/justlend-skills/scripts/mcp_server.mjs"],
      "env": {
        "TRONGRID_API_KEY": "your_key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Claude Code

Add to `.claude/settings.local.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "justlend": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO/justlend-skills/scripts/mcp_server.mjs"],
      "env": {
        "TRONGRID_API_KEY": "your_key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Codex

Codex reads the bundled [`.codex/`](.codex/INSTALL.md) manifest — register the same stdio command (`node /ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO/justlend-skills/scripts/mcp_server.mjs`, env `TRONGRID_API_KEY`) in your Codex MCP config; details in [`.codex/INSTALL.md`](.codex/INSTALL.md).

### OpenCode

OpenCode loads the bundled `.opencode/` plugin, which auto-discovers each skill from its `SKILL.md` frontmatter. Point OpenCode at this directory (or symlink `.opencode/`); the read-only MCP server registers the same way (`node .../scripts/mcp_server.mjs`, env `TRONGRID_API_KEY`).

### Verifying a client loaded the skills

- **Discovery:** ask the agent *"which JustLend skills do you have?"* — it should name the six skills. If it lists none, the skills path/symlink is wrong (see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)).
- **MCP tools:** ask for the tool list, or in Claude Code run `/mcp` — the `justlend` server should expose the 9 read tools (`get_all_markets`, `get_account_summary`, …).

### Handling conflicts

- **Duplicate skill names:** if another package also ships a `justlend-*` skill, install only one — same-named skills shadow each other and the agent may load the wrong `SKILL.md`.
- **Two MCP servers:** don't register both this read-only server and the full server under the **same** `justlend` name — the second registration wins. Give the full server a distinct name (e.g. `justlend-write`) if you want both, or just use the full server (it is a superset of the read tools).

## Available MCP Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `get_all_markets` | All markets with supply/borrow APY, mining rewards, and TVL |
| `get_dashboard` | Protocol overview: total supply, borrow, TVL, user count |
| `get_supported_markets` | List all supported markets with jToken/underlying addresses |
| `get_jtoken_details` | Detailed jToken info: interest rate model, reserves, mining rewards |
| `get_account_summary` | Health factor, liquidity, liquidation risk |
| `get_account_data_from_api` | Comprehensive account data from API (positions, rewards) |
| `get_trx_balance` | Native TRX balance |
| `get_token_balance` | TRC20 token balance (USDT, USDD, etc.) |
| `check_allowance` | Check TRC20 approval status for JustLend contracts |

Each read tool takes an `address` and/or a token/jToken argument (exact inputs are in each skill's `SKILL.md`) and returns JSON. On failure the **bundled server** returns a plain-text `Error: <message>` result flagged `isError` — never a thrown exception. The **full server** goes further and structures errors as `{ error, errorCode, retryable, hint }`, so an agent can branch on `retryable` and act on the `hint` without parsing prose.

## Skill Inputs, Outputs & Failure Handling

| Skill | Reads with | Writes with (full server) | Returns | On failure |
|-------|-----------|---------------------------|---------|-----------|
| `justlend-dao` (base) | the 9 read tools above | — | market / account JSON | retryable read errors (rate-limit, timeout) are safe to retry with backoff |
| `justlend-lending-v1` | `get_account_summary`, `check_allowance` | `approve_underlying` → `supply` / `borrow` / `repay` / `withdraw` | tx hash + post-state | **never auto-retry a write** — a repay/borrow may have landed; re-query `get_account_summary` first |
| `justlend-lending-v2` | market / vault reads | `approve_vault` → `supply_collateral` / `borrow` / `withdraw_collateral` / `liquidate` | tx hash + position | same no-retry rule; `liquidate` is irreversible — confirm target and amount |
| `justlend-trx-staking` | balance reads | `stake_trx_to_strx` / `unstake_strx` | tx hash | `unstake_strx` starts an **unbonding period** — not instant |
| `justlend-energy-rental` | market reads | rental tools | tx hash + order | quote first; price can move between quote and order |
| `justlend-energy-purchase` | config / quote / order / history / payment risk | `buy_energy_direct` | payment tx + order state | confirm exact quote; backend broadcasts; ambiguous results block a second payment |
| `justlend-governance-v1` | `get_proposal_list`, `get_vote_info` | `approve_jst_for_voting` → `deposit_jst_for_votes` → `cast_vote` → `withdraw_votes_*` | tx hash + vote state | `deposit_jst_for_votes` locks JST as WJST until withdrawal |

**Write failure contract:** the host must confirm each write with the user (HITL), preview first, and on any error **re-query state before retrying**. Mutating contract calls are not idempotent. Energy direct purchase is the narrow exception: its service may retry only the **same signed transaction** internally; it must never create a second payment silently.

## Agent Workflows

Real closed loops — user utterance → skill/tool routing → output → next step.

### Read + advise (routing: picks the read skill, not a write)

**User:** *"Is it worth borrowing USDT on JustLend right now, and can my account take it?"*
1. Agent loads **`justlend-dao`** — this is a read question, no write skill needed.
2. `get_all_markets` → USDT borrow APY and mining offset.
3. `get_account_summary` → current health factor and borrow limit.
4. **Output:** "USDT borrow APY is X% (Y% after mining). Your health factor is 2.1; borrowing $500 drops it to ~1.6 — still safe. To actually borrow you'll need the full server plus a wallet."

No funds move — the agent stops at advice because this project is read-only.

### V1 vs V2 disambiguation

**User:** *"Borrow against my collateral."*
- The agent asks one routing question — **pooled (V1)** or **isolated market (V2)**? — because `justlend-lending-v1` and `justlend-lending-v2` are different skills with different risk models (per-market `lltv`, isolation).
- "USDT from the main pool" → `justlend-lending-v1`; "against my wstUSDT in the isolated market" → `justlend-lending-v2`.

### Write path with HITL (full server + wallet)

**User:** *"Supply 500 USDT to JustLend."* → **`justlend-lending-v1`**
1. `check_allowance` (read) — is USDT approved for the jUSDT market?
2. If not: `approve_underlying` — the agent shows amount + spender and **waits for user confirmation** before signing. For USDT/USDC/USDJ the tool defensively resets the allowance to 0 first (parity with the official front-end), so the user may see two transactions; the tool sequences them automatically.
3. `supply` — **HITL confirm** (amount, market, direction), simulate first, then sign.
4. `get_account_summary` (read) — verify the new supply balance and health factor.

> **No auto-retry.** If step 3 errors, the agent re-queries state before doing anything else — a supply may already have landed.

### Error / boundary handling

- **Insufficient allowance** → agent surfaces the missing approval and proposes `approve_underlying` (HITL), never a silent MAX approval.
- **Health factor would breach** → agent refuses or warns before a borrow/withdraw that pushes `shortfallUSD > 0`.
- **Rate limit (TronGrid 429)** → reads are safe to retry after a short backoff (the full server marks these `errorCode: "transient"`, `retryable: true`). Writes are **not** retried automatically.
- **Full server not installed** → a write skill reports the missing dependency and points to [@justlend/mcp-server-justlend](https://github.com/justlend/mcp-server-justlend); it does not fake a transaction.

## Safety & Boundaries

- **This project is read-only.** The bundled MCP server (`scripts/mcp_server.mjs`) and the CLI only *query* — no transaction signing, no writes, no fund movement. It cannot move or lose funds.
- **Credentials.** The only secret is a **TronGrid API key** (read-only RPC access), stored locally in `.env` (git-ignored). No signing key is used or stored by this project.
- **Write operations live in the full server.** supply/borrow/repay/withdraw, sTRX staking, energy rental/direct purchase, and governance voting run through [@justlend/mcp-server-justlend](https://github.com/justlend/mcp-server-justlend), which requires a **signing wallet**. When you enable those, the host MUST:
  - **confirm every write with the user (HITL)** before signing — show amount, market, and direction;
  - **never auto-retry a mutating call** (a repay / borrow / liquidate / vote may already have landed) — re-query state first;
  - simulate / preview first, and prefer **Nile testnet** (`NETWORK=nile`) before mainnet.
- **Per-module risk (highest-consequence, irreversible):** `liquidate` (V2), `unstake` (sTRX — has an unbonding period), and `cast_vote` (locks JST as WJST until withdrawal). Treat these as destructive.

### Per-skill risk profile

| Skill | Class | Reversible? | Cost / lock | HITL |
|-------|-------|-------------|-------------|:----:|
| `justlend-dao` (base) | read-only | n/a | none | no |
| `justlend-lending-v1` | write | yes (repay / withdraw) | gas + interest | yes |
| `justlend-lending-v2` | write incl. **`liquidate`** | borrow/repay yes; **liquidate no** | gas; liquidation seizes collateral | yes |
| `justlend-trx-staking` | write | **`unstake` delayed** (unbonding) | gas + unbonding wait | yes |
| `justlend-energy-rental` | write, **spends TRX** | no (consumed) | rental fee | yes |
| `justlend-energy-purchase` | write, **signs TRX payment** | no after backend broadcast | quoted payment + possible activation fee | yes, exact quote |
| `justlend-governance-v1` | write | vote reclaimable after proposal ends | **JST locked as WJST** | yes |

### If an agent misfires (recovery)

- **Wrong skill / wrong market** → because writes are HITL, catch it at the confirm prompt: reject and restate market + amount. Nothing signs without approval.
- **A write may have half-landed** (client crash, timeout) → do **not** re-send. Re-query `get_account_summary` (or `get_vote_info` / balances) for the real state, then decide.
- **Direct-purchase result unknown** → call `get_energy_payment_risk`; never sign a second payment while the first is unresolved. The full server may retry only the same signed transaction.
- **Accidental approval** → revoke by setting the allowance back to 0 (`amount='0'` on the approve tool — the same `approve(0)` the write flow uses).
- **Stuck in unbonding / locked votes** → these are protocol timelocks, not errors; wait out the period, then `unstake_strx` / `withdraw_votes_*`.

## Data & Privacy

- **What's read:** on-chain market/account data plus the JustLend read APIs. A queried **address is sent to TronGrid and the JustLend `/account` API** to fetch its balances / positions.
- **What's stored:** the bundled read-only tools persist nothing beyond your local `.env` key. When the full server's energy purchase workflow is enabled, it stores public payer/tx identifiers (never signed transactions) in a local `0600` risk file so an ambiguous result blocks duplicate payment.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| Agent lists **no** JustLend skills | skills path/symlink wrong, or client not restarted | check the `skills/` symlink for your client ([Client Configuration](#client-configuration)); restart the agent so it re-reads manifests |
| **Wrong** skill fires (read when you meant write, or V1 vs V2) | overlapping triggers | the frontmatter carries negative triggers — state the operation explicitly ("supply", "borrow on V2") |
| `401` / `403` on reads | missing or invalid `TRONGRID_API_KEY` | set a valid key in `.env`; verify with `node scripts/justlend_api.mjs markets` |
| `429` / slow reads | TronGrid rate limit | back off and retry; upgrade the TronGrid plan for higher throughput |
| Empty market/account data | key works but network mismatch | check `NETWORK` (`mainnet` vs `nile`) matches the address you're querying |
| A write skill "does nothing" | full MCP server or signing wallet not installed | install [@justlend/mcp-server-justlend](https://github.com/justlend/mcp-server-justlend) and connect a wallet — the bundled server never signs |
| MCP server won't start | Node < 20, or deps not installed | `node -v` (need v20+); run `npm install` |
| Behaviour changed after update | version / manifest drift | compare installed version with [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md); re-run `npm install` and restart |

**Logs & version.** The CLI and server print errors to stderr — run the CLI command directly to see the raw error and the offending address/token. Include the project version from `package.json` / `skills/_meta.json` when filing an issue.
