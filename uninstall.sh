Manual cleanup (this script does not edit files it did not create):
  • Remove the "justlend" MCP entry from your client config, e.g.:
      - Claude Desktop: ~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
      - Claude Code:    .claude/settings.local.json
      - Cursor:         .cursor/mcp.json
      - Codex:          ~/.codex/  (see .codex/INSTALL.md)
      - OpenCode:       .opencode/ plugin entry
  • Delete the cloned justlend-skills directory itself if no longer needed.
NOTE

echo "✅ Uninstallation complete."
