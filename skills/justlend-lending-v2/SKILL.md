# JustLend V2 Lending

Isolated-market lending skill for **JustLend V2** on TRON — a Morpho-style protocol that
separates the supply side (curated **ERC4626 vaults**) from the borrow side (permissionless
**isolated markets**). Each market is a single `(loanToken, collateralToken, oracle, irm, lltv)`
pair, so risk is contained per-market rather than pooled like JustLend V1.

> **Naming**: V2's on-chain contracts and MCP tools are named `Moolah` / `moolah_*` (e.g.
> `MoolahProxy`, `get_moolah_vault`). That is the technical identifier for the V2 system — this
> skill refers to the product as **JustLend V2** throughout and uses the `moolah_*` names only
> where they match the actual tool/contract surface.

> **Note**: This skill requires the full MCP server v1.1.0+
> ([@justlend/mcp-server-justlend](https://github.com/justlend/mcp-server-justlend)), which added
> the 30 V2 tools and 4 AI prompts below. The lite bundled server (read-only V1) does not
> include them.

## V1 vs V2 — when to use which

| | V1 (pooled) | V2 (isolated) |
|---|---|---|
| Risk model | Shared pool, one health factor across all assets | Per-market, isolated collateral/loan pair |
| Supply | Supply any market directly | Deposit into a **vault** (ERC4626) that allocates across markets |
| Borrow | Borrow against pooled collateral | `supplyCollateral` into a market, then `borrow` the loan token |
| Risk metric | `shortfallUSD` / health factor | `risk` (0–1 ratio of borrow vs max) + market `lltv` |

## Core concepts

- **Vault (supply side)** — an ERC4626 vault. You `deposit` the loan asset (e.g. USDT) and receive
  shares; the curator allocates liquidity across isolated markets. `withdraw`/`redeem` to exit.
- **Market (borrow side)** — an isolated `(loanToken, collateralToken, oracle, irm, lltv)` tuple
  identified by a `bytes32` market id. You `supplyCollateral`, then `borrow` up to `lltv` of the
  collateral's oracle value, and `repay` / `withdrawCollateral` to unwind.
- **LLTV** — Liquidation Loan-To-Value (18-decimal ratio). Borrow position must stay below it.
- **risk** — 0–1 ratio of current borrow to max borrowable. `risk → 1` means liquidatable. There is
  **no single account-wide health factor** in V2; risk is per-market.
- **Liquidation** — a public liquidator can repay an unhealthy position's debt and seize collateral.

## Critical rules

### Risk is per-market, not account-wide
Unlike V1's single health factor, V2 risk lives in each market. Always call
`get_moolah_user_position` (or `get_moolah_history` for the full picture) and inspect the
`risk` ratio (0–1) **and** the market `lltv` before advising. `risk` near 1 ⇒ liquidatable.

### Approve before write
Vault deposits need `approve_moolah_vault`; market collateral/borrow/repay need
`approve_moolah_proxy`; liquidation needs `approve_liquidator_token`. The full server returns a
structured `errorCode: INSUFFICIENT_ALLOWANCE` with a `hint` if you skip this — approve, then retry.

### Vaults are the supply side, markets are the borrow side
To *earn*, use a **vault** (`moolah_vault_deposit`). To *borrow*, use a **market**
(`moolah_supply_collateral` → `moolah_borrow`). Don't conflate the two.

## Typical workflows

### Supply (earn) via a vault
1. `get_moolah_vaults` — compare vault APYs
2. `approve_moolah_vault` — approve the loan asset
3. `moolah_vault_deposit` — deposit; later `moolah_vault_redeem` to exit

### Borrow against collateral in an isolated market
1. `get_moolah_markets` — pick a `(collateral, loan)` market; note its `lltv`
2. `approve_moolah_proxy` → `moolah_supply_collateral`
3. `moolah_borrow` — borrow below `lltv`; monitor with `get_moolah_user_position`
4. `moolah_repay` → `moolah_withdraw_collateral` to unwind

### Liquidate an unhealthy position
1. `get_moolah_pending_liquidations` — find liquidatable positions
2. `get_moolah_liquidation_quote` — check seize vs repay economics
3. `approve_liquidator_token` → `moolah_liquidate`

## Examples

- "Compare the APYs of all JustLend V2 vaults — which USDT vault pays the most?"
- "Supply 5000 USDT into the best JustLend V2 vault."
- "Open a borrow position: supply BTC as collateral and borrow USDT on JustLend V2. What's the LLTV?"
- "Check my JustLend V2 positions — is any market close to liquidation?"
- "Show me the pending liquidations on JustLend V2 and the quote to liquidate the riskiest one."
- "How much energy will a V2 supply-collateral-and-borrow cost?"
